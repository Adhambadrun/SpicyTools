# SpicyTerminal

Paste flights from Google Flights, airline sites, emails or screenshots —
get a perfect, copy-paste-ready **GDS Black Window itinerary**.

**[Open / Deploy](#deploy)** · Made by **Adham Badran** — SpicyTerminal

## Why

One job, done perfectly. A deterministic offline engine — real IATA
aircraft codes, 12-hour GDS clocks, overnight markers, exact booking-class
handling, hidden-stop merging, one chronological ticket order. No
hallucinations, no re-rolling the dice.

- **Fast, bounded offline screenshots**: OCR is lazy-loaded, uses a worker where available, caps oversized frames, and has a short native-OCR deadline—so a stalled scanner cannot leave the app spinning forever.
- **Parallel AI fallback**: when the fast direct OCR passes have not found flights after ~1.5s, the Gemini fallback starts *immediately* and races the remaining bounded direct re-reads instead of running after them serially — a screenshot the offline engine cannot read answers in AI-time (not 14.5s-of-local-grinding + AI-time). The deterministic result always wins when both succeed; a junk direct read full of `????` placeholders is auto re-read by AI without a manual press.
- **AI mistake detection & self-learning — that refuses to learn nonsense**: the
  AI's answer is compared to the deterministic one **leg by leg** (same carrier,
  same flight-number digits after look-alike folding, same route, same day), never
  by row position, so a differently-segmented answer can no longer "correct" the
  wrong leg. A rule is only stored when the difference is a genuine scanner
  confusion (`O/0`, `I/1`, `S/5`, `Z/2`, `B/8`, `G/6`, `C/0`, `T/7`), and a rule
  that reverses an existing one cancels both instead of making the tool oscillate.
  Learned rules are applied to **screenshot OCR only** — a typed or pasted
  itinerary is ground truth and is never rewritten.
  A rule store written by the older learner is swept once on load, so already-
  poisoned devices self-heal instead of keeping their contradictory rules.
- **GDS rows are read as tables**: a screenshot of a terminal (or a re-paste of
  this tool's own output) keeps its columns. `15SEP` is no longer split into
  `15 SEP`, the flight-time column `6.10` is no longer mistaken for a clock, the
  sell-status column `HK2`/`TK2` no longer becomes a phantom Turkish leg, a glued
  `MIAVVI` is unrolled into its two airports, and a carrier the data file does
  not know yet (IberoJet `OB`) is still read instead of dropped.
- **`AI FIX` — the repair button, not the default path**: pasting converts on its own, no click needed.
  When that automatic offline pass cannot read an image (handwritten, cropped, garbage-scanned) or only
  half-reads it, `AI FIX` re-reads the same input with Gemini and repairs the result; the deterministic
  answer still wins whenever both succeed. (The previous label read like a mode switch, which made
  people wait for an "auto" that had already run and come back empty.)
- **Reliable attachments**: `+ ATTACH`, drag-and-drop, and clipboard screenshots share one queue; image extensions are detected even when a browser supplies no MIME type, multiple images are parsed together in order, and stale work cannot overwrite a cleared request. Each screenshot has a small red `×` remove button, can be clicked to review full-size, and can also be removed from the review screen.
- **Word-proof carriers**: English words that are also IATA codes (`to`, `by`,
  `at`…) stay words. `to London` / `to Los Angeles` is no longer rewritten as
  a phantom Transavia `TO 105`, and bare `Manchester` is MAN (UK), not MHT.
- **Direction-proof routes**: every leg keeps the origin/destination it was
  pasted with. A route is read whether it sits on a short line or on a long
  Google-Flights card line, whether it is written `(JFK) to Dublin (DUB)`,
  `(JFK) TO Dublin (DUB)`, bare `SZX to DMM`, or after the flight number — so an
  outbound can no longer be printed with the return's airports.
- **Accent-proof cities**: cities are read the way their country spells them —
  `Bogotá`, `Zürich`, `São Paulo`, `Malmö`, `Kraków` — composed or decomposed
  (macOS pastes the latter). An accented letter used to hide a leg's route
  header, so the outbound silently borrowed the return's airports *and* the
  return's date; it no longer can.
- **Card lists keep their clocks**: on a Google-Flights-style card the time pair
  (`3:45 PM to 10:15 AM`) is printed *above* the flight number and below the
  previous leg. One leg used to get it right and every leg after it printed
  `????`; now that standalone line belongs to the flight under it, and only a
  whole line — never the tail of a neighbouring leg's own line.
- **Published mileages**: distances are WGS-84 geodesic miles (Vincenty), which
  is what airlines and GDS systems quote. A spherical great circle runs up to
  ~0.5% short on east/west routes — JFK-DUB read 3171 instead of the published
  3179 — and near-antipodal pairs fall back to the spherical value rather than
  failing.
- **Text and PDF attachments**: `.txt`, `.eml`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.html`, `.ics`, and similar text exports are read instantly; PDFs are passed to AI only when the user explicitly supplies a Gemini key.
- **Weekly report**: One-click weekly performance and enhancement reports sent to `adhambadraan@gmail.com` to improve and enhance the tool to the max. Each report covers one week (Monday 00:00 UTC → now), compares it with the previous week, and keeps a separate lifetime total — a closed week is archived, never mixed into the current one. A *conversion* is a result shown to the user: live re-renders while typing and AI replies the direct read beat are counted as neither.
- **About, in one click**: the `About` link leads the status row (`About / Generate Api /
  Weekly Report / Report a bug`) and opens a dialog that says what the engine does, what it
  deliberately refuses to do, and who built it — no marketing, no fluff, `Esc` closes it and
  focus goes back where it was.
- 100% offline, private — itineraries and screenshots never leave the browser.
- `???` never appears as an aircraft; inferred values are disclosed.
- Never drops a flight row silently.

## Deploy

The whole app is one static file, built by `npm run build` into
`public/index.html` (an offline copy is also written to the repo root).

- **Vercel**: import this repo — `vercel.json` already sets the build command
  and output directory, so every `git push` to `main` deploys automatically.
- **Netlify from Git**: connect this repo — `netlify.toml` builds and
  publishes `public/`.
- **Netlify Drop**: drag the generated `index.html` onto <https://app.netlify.com/drop>

Only the single built file is ever deployed; repository screenshots, sources
and archives are never shipped.

## Privacy

No accounts, no cookies, no tracking, nothing is sent anywhere unless the
user explicitly uses the AI fallback with their own Gemini key.
Weekly reports and bug reports open directly in the user's email client to `adhambadraan@gmail.com`.
