/* test_ai_fix_label.js — the repair button must be called AI FIX everywhere.
 *
 * `AI AUTO` described a mechanism nobody asked for; the button's job is to fix a
 * conversion the automatic offline pass could not finish, and users kept waiting
 * for an "auto" that had in fact already run and come back empty. So:
 *   - the label says AI FIX, in the artifact, in every status hint, in the
 *     welcome card, in the key dialog, in the About dialog and in the README;
 *   - the id stays `btnAi`, because the attachment/GDS suites fire `btnAi`
 *     directly and a renamed id would silently skip those tests;
 *   - the rename stopped at the labels: the machine-visible status strings the
 *     other suites pin (AI CONVERTED / AI REPLY IGNORED — direct result kept /
 *     AI failed) were NOT touched;
 *   - `✦ AI`, the older name for the same control, is gone.
